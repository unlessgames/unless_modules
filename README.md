## nightly builds of unless_modules

This repo provides automatic builds of my modules for those who want to help with testing them before updates hit the VCV Library.

If you don't want to deal with possibly broken modules, [get them from the Library](https://library.vcvrack.com/unless_modules) instead.

The nightly builds can be found at the [releases](https://github.com/unlessgames/unless_modules/releases), they need to be [manually installed](https://vcvrack.com/manual/Installing#installing-plugins-not-available-on-the-vcv-library) in order to work.

Source code can be found at [gitlab.com/unlessgames/unless_modules](https://gitlab.com/unlessgames/unless_modules).
